# STACKSWORTH Infinity  
### 10″ Touchscreen Bitcoin Node & Hub Dashboard

**STACKSWORTH Infinity** is the flagship 10-inch model in the StacksWorth lineup — a self-contained Bitcoin node and BitAxe hub running on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a full-color capacitive touchscreen display.

It unites **StacksWorth’s signature dashboard UI**, **local data services**, and **BitAxe integration** into one powerful, always-on Bitcoin appliance.

---

## ⚡ Vision

Infinity is designed to be the **heart of a sovereign Bitcoin environment** — a local hub that runs a full node, connects to BitAxe miners, and displays Bitcoin’s live pulse through the same StacksWorth UI language used across **Matrix** and **Spark**.

All data is sourced locally whenever possible.  
No cloud dependency.  
No third-party dashboards.  
Just Bitcoin — visualized.

## 🧠 System Overview

| Layer | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| **StacksWorth Hub (`stx-hub`)** | Local Python FastAPI service exposing unified JSON endpoints for Bitcoin, BitAxe, and system metrics |
| **StacksWorth UI** | Fullscreen HTML / CSS / JS dashboard rendered in Chromium kiosk mode |
| **Bitcoin Node** | Native `bitcoind` running on SSD; primary blockchain and mempool source |
| **BitAxe Integration** | Local polling of BitAxe devices for hashrate, temperature, shares, and status |
| **Host System** | Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) optimized for kiosk and node workloads |

- [ ] Bitcoin Core install and sync
- [ ] SSH access and firewall hardening

### Phase 2 — StacksWorth Hub
- [ ] FastAPI service scaffold
- [ ] Local endpoints (`/price`, `/height`, `/fees`, `/miner`, `/bitaxe`)
- [ ] System health metrics
- [ ] Local caching and rate limiting

### Phase 3 — UI Dashboard
- [ ] Fullscreen Chromium kiosk
- [ ] Responsive 10″ layout
- [ ] Touch-first navigation
- [ ] Match Spark UI design language

### Phase 4 — BitAxe Integration
- [ ] Local BitAxe discovery
- [ ] Hashrate, temperature, and shares
- [ ] Multi-device overview
- [ ] Alerts and status indicators

### Phase 5 — Polish & Hardening
- [ ] Auto-start all services
- [ ] Offline and error handling
- [ ] UI watchdog and recovery
- [ ] Thermal and power stability testing

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Local-first** — Bitcoin data comes from your node
- **Consistent UI** — Infinity feels like Spark and Matrix
- **Appliance-grade** — Power on → dashboard loads
- **Hackable, not fragile** — Clean, readable architecture

---

## 🚧 Project Status

> **Planning & Architecture Phase**

This document defines the initial build direction for **STACKSWORTH Infinity**.  
Implementation will proceed incrementally once hardware selection is finalized.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Infinity does **not** power other devices — it can *serve data* to them
- It is a peer hub, not a dependency
- Designed for node runners, builders, and serious Bitcoiners
